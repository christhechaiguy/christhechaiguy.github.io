                    <h2>About</h2>

                    <p>The program started by collecting gently used skateboard equipment and donating it to low-income communities. When a small group of skateboarders dropped off some complete skateboards the first year of running this program, they had no idea how appreciative and excited the youth would be to be receiving such a gift. They were met with a huge line-up of youth, engaged and wanting to get a board for themselves. The skaters left with a promise to collect more boards, raise funds and awareness for next time, so that every youth could have an opportunity to try skateboarding.</p>
                    <p>From there, the program has grown to further support families in need. By mentoring youth through physical activity programming and supplying them with the tools and resources to be successful and confident in and outside of programming, our program has empowered youth to get inspired about helping out their communities and being leaders of change.</p>
                    <p>For Pivots Sake (FPS) manages operations through Birling skateshop. Birling collects and donates used equipment to communities in need as well as to OSA supported camps and programming, and to like-minded business partners like Maru, who refurbish materials into merchandise and donate a portion of the proceeds back to FPS.</p>





                    <h2>Current Programming</h2>
                    
                    <h4>Ottawa Community Housing</h4>
                    <p>We have a working relationship with Ottawa community housing (OCH). Ottawa Community Housing’s vision is to be a leader in providing safe and affordable homes to enable OCH tenants to fully participate in the socio-economic opportunities of the City. As a leader in the delivery of quality, affordable housing, OCH collaborates with others to develop safe and healthy communities.</p>
                    <p>Ottawa Community Housing’s portfolio of homes is spread throughout the City of Ottawa and includes apartments in low-rise and high-rise apartment buildings, townhouses, row houses, detached houses and rooming houses. In addition each OCH has a dedicated unit for programming that facilitates the connection to youth, as well as equipment, storage and support staff.</p>

                    <h4>Pathways to Education</h4>
                    <p>Pathways to Education is a national, charitable organization breaking the cycle of poverty through education. Its award-winning program is creating positive social change by supporting youth living in low-income communities to overcome barriers to education, graduate from high school, and build the foundation for a successful future. Through the collective power of partnerships, Pathways to Education’s innovative program is preparing youth for tomorrow.</p>
