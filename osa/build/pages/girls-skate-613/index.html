                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>Since its inception as Girls Only Sessions at McNabb’s old indoor park, Girls+ Skate 613 have hosted hundreds of people, many starting off as beginners who have progressed into skating daily. After its first year in 2006 with a few dedicated staff at McNabb and volunteers, the Girls sessions went on hiatus. Realizing the need for opportunities for girls and women to skate, the sessions were started up again in the summer of 2014 and had a significant response from the community. Each year since, the attendees have doubled and our local skate community is expanding.</p>

                    <p>Recognizing that girls, women, LGBTQ2+ folks and other marginalized groups do not have the same opportunities in sports, Girls+ Skate 613 is dedicated to providing support and structure. The positive influences of skateboarding are seen first-hand at these sessions and we are committed to help ensure that people in Ottawa have the opportunity to empower themselves through skateboarding. This support includes providing equipment, facilitating a space for skating, hosting events, providing resources and education, and fundraising for the cause.</p>
                    <p>Girls+ Skate 613 receives support from the OSA and we are stoked to be a part of helping #GirlsSkate613 thrive and grow!</p>

                    <h2>Are you interested in getting into skating?</h2>
                    <p>If you’d like to get involved, simply come out to the next session! Girls+ skate sessions are held once a week in the warmer months on Thursday evenings from 6-8 p.m. at Charlie Bowins Skatepark.</p>
                    <p>Girls+ Skate 613 and the City of Ottawa collaborate to host a week-long summer camp every year. Updates on camp will be posted on the Recreation section of the City’s website as well as on our social media feeds.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Are you interested in supporting our programming?</h2>
                    <p>Girls+ Skate 613 is currently seeking donations of time and money to provide coaching, gear, and access to facilities to skateboard year-round. Girls+ Skate 613 is also in need of donations from businesses in the way of healthy snacks and beverages for our weekly meet-ups as well as prizing for contests and camp activities.
                    <p>Please contact girlsskate613@gmail.com today for more information on how you can get involved!
